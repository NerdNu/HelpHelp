### Arenas
> About PvP arenas.

While PvP (player-vs-player combat) is disabled on PvE, you can build PvP
arenas where PvP will be enabled, subject to approval by the P admins. Once
you have completed your build, do a `/modreq` to ask for the PvP flag to be set.
  
To be approved, PvP arenas must be clearly marked, completely enclosed, and
access-restricted builds. The area must only be accessible via iron doors that
require a button press to enter. These entrances must be marked with signs 
stating that it is a PvP area, and that players enter at their own risk. The 
PvP-enabled area may not exceed 100x100 blocks, and may not interact with other
PvP areas in any way.
  

### Bans
> If you are banned.

If you are banned, you will not be unbanned automatically. You must make a
written appeal asking to be unbanned at http://nerd.nu/appeal.

Do not play on the server using another account while
you are banned; that is against the rules.


### Beds
> About beds.

You can set your spawn point by sleeping in a bed. You do not need to stay in
it until the screen turns dark, you only need to right click on the bed at night.


### Claims
> Claiming land to build on.

You may claim unused land for your build by surrounding the area with fence or
cobble walls and putting access points at reasonable intervals. Land claims are
valid from the surface you are building on up to sky limit (in oceans they are
also valid to the ocean floor). There is an example of this in spawn if you
wish to see one.

You may not build in someone else's fenced area, and they may not build in 
yours - if you encounter any issues please contact an admin. Please be 
considerate in your claims. Don’t claim huge areas of land for a small number 
of players, and don’t build on or claim land that is too close to other claims.
Give people some space; the map is large.


### Commands
> Full list of commands.

The help system is still under development. A future version will show a full
command list here.

For now, try `/help Plugins` or `/help <command>`.


### Custom Drops
> Custom items dropped by mobs.

Many hostile and passive mobs have a small chance of dropping their head when
killed. If Minecraft has a standard head for the mob (the dragon, skeletons,
zombies and creepers) then that item will be dropped. Otherwise, it will be a
player head with a skin that matches the mob. For example, witches drop the
*MHF_Witch* player head.

Some hostile mobs also drop a named, lored, enchanted ghast tear called
‘_Essence of Flight_’, that can be crafted with a dragon head to make elytra
(wings).

The drop probabilities of these custom drops and the player skin names are
listed in the configuration of the GoneBatty plugin, at http://goo.gl/mJpFqy.

See also: `/help Elytras`.


### Discord
> About Discord text and and voice chat.

We're giving _Discord_ a try, as an alternative to Mumble. Discord does text
and voice chat in the browser, or with a downloadable client. Check it out at
https://discord.gg/dKFfHY3.

See also `/help Mumble`. 
 

### Donate
> How to support the servers.

You can donate to help the server at http://nerd.nu/donate.


### Doppelgangers
> Custom summonable hostile mobs.

Doppelgangers are summonable, custom hostile mobs. In the current 
configuration, they are extremely strong and well-armed wither skeletons. 
They drop the player head of your choosing. To summon a doppleganger, name a 
pumpkin after the player whose head you want, using an anvil. Then stack
two diamond blocks vertically and put the pumpkin on top, sort of like 
summoning a snow golem. Note that you need to leave a one-block air gap on all 
sides of the pillar of blocks.

The PvE server admins (P admins or Padmins) have special doppelgangers that
are twice as expensive as regular players' doppelgangers. To summon a Padmin
doppelganger, you must place the named pumpkin on a T shape built from four
diamond blocks, instead of two. Padmin doppelgangers are even stronger than
regular doppelgangers, always appear as a group of all current Padmins when
you summon any one of them, and the summoned Padmin drops a dragon head in
addition to the Padmin's head. You can find a current list of Padmins on the
NerdNu staff page at http://nerd.nu/staff.


### Elytras
> How to get elytras.

Elytras (wings) occur naturally in end cities, but as there are only a limited
number of those and a lot of players on PvE, we also allow them to be crafted.
To craft elytras, combine one _Essence of Flight_ and one dragon head in your
crafting square. Both of these items can be obtained, with a high probability,
by killing the dragon. Alternatively, you can get _Essence of Flight_ as a
random drop from killing hostile mobs (see `/help Custom Drops`) and you can
get a dragon head from killing a P admin doppelganger (see `/help Doppelgangers`).


### Farms
> About farms.

There are many farms on the map where players can get food. If you harvest 
crops, you must replant. Not replanting can result in a ban.
 
If you come across an un-replanted field, ModReq it for crop grief.


### FAQ
> Frequently-Asked Questions

> Why doesn’t my water/lava flow?

To prevent grief. You can make it flow with `/modreq flow`. See `/help Liquids`.

> Why can’t I open my chest/door/whatever?

You may be holding a wooden sword, which queries the WorldGuard region of 
whatever you click on. Alternatively, maybe the chest is locked by someone
else? See `/help Locks`.

> Why isn't my hopper working?

Run `/chopper on` and then punch the container (e.g. chest, furnace) that the
hopper is feeding into. That will probably fix it. 

> Why can’t I build here?

You're in a protection region. See `/help Protection`. You may even still be
at spawn. Move further away and you will find unbuilt land.

> How can I join a town?

Towns usually have a protection region that is the same as their name.
 
Try `/region info <town>`, and then contact one of the players listed as a
region owner.

> What are the towns called?

Most towns have an associated _place_. See `/help Places`.

> Why can’t I light a portal?

Portals connect up weirdly in Minecraft when they are too close together. 
The admins pre-make a small number of portals when they build the map. 
See `/help Portals`.

> Can I get a teleport to _wherever_?

Nope, sorry. Walk, ride a vehicle or use a portal instead.

> Why does the server restart (so often)?

Minecraft and its plugins just run better when restarted every few hours. 
See `/help Restarts`.

> When is the next rev?

See `/help Revisions`.


### Features
> Special features of this server.

Many special features of PvE are discussed in the **PvE Rev ${rev-number} Info Post**
${rev-post}.

PvE is a substantially “vanilla” Minecraft survival mode server, with 
custom-generated terrain and a custom ore distribution. Plugins have been added
to allow chests and other containers to be locked (`/help Locks`) and to
protect builds from unauthorised edits (`/help Protection`). To prevent 
unauthorised edits using water or lava, liquids don’t flow until requested by a
ModReq (`/help ModReq`, `/help Liquids`). 

Private chat for self-managing groups of players is provided by NerdClanChat 
(`/help NerdClanChat`).

Tamed horses cannot be ridden except by their owner, but can be shared with 
commands (see `/help Horses`). Horses are improved through training, rather
than by breeding.

Most mobs have a small chance of dropping their heads when killed by a player.
They may also drop a special item, called ‘_Essence of Flight_’, that can be
used to craft Elytra. See `/help Custom Drops` and `/help Elytras`.

We have a Mumble server for voice chat. See `/help Mumble`. We also have a 
top-down dynamic map and an isometric cartograph. See `/help Map`.

You can build custom maps to place in item frames. See `/help MapWorld`.

PvP is allowed in designated PvP arenas. See `/help Arenas`. 
 	
### Fire
> Using fire.

Fire spread is disabled on PvE. You can light your own fires with flint and steel.

  
### Grief
> Rules about unauthorised edits.

The word "grief" is used to refer to any unauthorised edits to the world. It 
is against the rules to edit other players' builds without their permission. 
You are allowed to harvest other players' farms, but you must replant.

You are also allowed to kill farm animals (sheep, pigs, cows and rabbits), but
you must leave a breeding pair of each colour or type. It is against the 
rules to kill tamed pets (cats, dogs) or trapped hostile mobs.


### Grinders
> About grinders.

You can build mob grinders around spawner blocks, in ocean monuments and using
various other game mechanics. If you find a spawner, you can ModReq to get it
protected against grief, even if you haven’t built anything there yet.

You can also build dark room grinders, but the chances are they won’t perform
as well on a multi-player server as they would in the single player game.


### Help
> How to use the help system.

Example: `/help features 2` - read page 2 of the “Features” topic.

* `/help` - show the topic index
* `/help <n>` - read page _\<n\>_ of the index
* `/help <text>` - show help about _\<text\>_. The _\<text\>_ can be a topic name
  the name of a plugin, or a command, if it begins with a '/'.
* `/help <text> <n>` - show page _\<n\>_ of the search results for _\<text\>_.

Note: searches are case-insensitive. 


### Homes
> About the `/home` command.

The `/home` command is disabled. The only way to set your home on PvE is to 
sleep in a bed. 


### Horses
> About horses on PvE.

Any horses you tame are automatically locked by the `EasyRider` plugin and
cannot be ridden by anyone else without your permission. `EasyRider` also
handles locking of llamas.

On PvE, all horses spawned naturally or by breeding have very poor performance 
attributes. Their attributes are _only_ improved by training:

 * _Speed_ is improved by total horizontal distance travelled while on the ground.    
 * _Health_ is improved by total weight of gold consumed, in the form of golden
   carrots and golden apples.
 * _Jump Strength_ is improved by total horizontal distance travelled in the air.

The current performance of a horse in each of these three abilities is 
characterised by a _level_ number. The attributes of a horse in a particular
ability only change when the _level_ increases to the next whole number, and
each ability has a _maximum level_ beyond which further training will not 
improve that ability.

To see the current ability levels of a horse, use `/horse-info`. To see
how much training is required to attain a particular level, use 
`/horse-upgrades`. To see who has the best horse in a specific ability, 
use `/horse-top`.

You can see a list of all horses you own with `/horse-list`, and you can get
directions to a specific horse with `/horse-gps`.

For more information about these commands, see `/help EasyRider` or the
plugin home page, https://github.com/NerdNu/EasyRider.


### Lag
> Guidance on reducing lag.

Large numbers of mobs contribute to server lag. As a result we are running 
`MobLimiter`, which only allows you to keep certain quantities of mobs 
(type `/moblimiter limits` for additional details). MobLimiter culls excess
animals when the chunk is unloaded, but it will always leave at least two of 
each type, including 2-4 of each wool colour.

Minecraft implements redstone very inefficiently. Even small redstone devices
contribute disproportionately to server lag. You should strive to minimise the
length of redstone wires and the frequency of signal state changes. Redstone 
clocks are allowed but should always include an off switch and they should 
not activate every tick.

Large numbers of hoppers can also lag the server. Wherever possible, try to move
items with flowing water over ice instead.

If you have questions please contact a moderator. See also `/help Redstone`.


### Lava
> About lava.

See `/help Liquids`.


### Liquids
> Non-flowing water and lava.

On this server, any water or lava you place will not flow on its own. If you 
want your liquid to flow, place it and then type `/modreq please flow this`
and a moderator will flow it as soon as they are able.

Region owners are also able to flow liquids in their own regions using the
`/flow` command. Type `/flow` for more information.


### Locks
> Commands for locking containers.

You can lock chests, trapped chests, furnaces, shulker boxes, skulls, beacons, 
dispensers, droppers, jukeboxes, hoppers, and brewing stands.

All of these blocks automatically lock privately to you when you place them, 
but you can change who can access them using the following commands:

 * `/cmodify public` - Allows anyone to access the contents but not break the
   chest. Useful for “Free Stuff” chests.
 * `/cmodify donation` - Allows people to open the chests and put items 
   inside, but only the owner can remove items.
 * `/cmodify <name>` - Add players to the access list.
 * `/cmodify @<name>` - Add a player as a lock administrator: someone who 
   can add other players.
 * `/cmodify -<name>` - Remove a player from the lock.
 * `/cmodify r:<region>` - Grant access to all members of the named 
   WorldGuard region.
 * `/cremove` - Removes all locks from the block and allows anyone to break 
   it. If you just want to make a chest public, use `/cmodify public` instead.
 * `/cprivate` - Lock a chest privately after it has been `/cremove`d. You 
   can also use player `<name>` or `r:<region>` arguments, as with `/cmodify`.
 * `/cpublic` or `/cdonation` - Lock a chest as public or donation after you
   have `/cremove`d it.  
 * `/cpersist` - Make a single LWC command apply to multiple containers.
 * `/chopper on` - Allow hoppers to insert items into a container (e.g. chest)
   that you punch.
 * `/lwc` - See a list of other commands related to locking. 

It is your responsibility to secure your valuables. If someone takes something
from a chest you gave them access to, we can not return it.

See also `/help LWC`.


### Map
> About the current map.

The map is a 6km x 6km square made with `WorldPainter` and featuring custom
tree models. It was made by Trooprm32.

A top-down live map of the overworld can be seen at http://nerd.nu/maps/pve/live
and an isometric cartograph can be viewed at http://nerd.nu/maps/pve/.
However, note that these maps won’t be available for the first few weeks of a 
new revision, in order to give people a chance to explore the map unaided.


### MapWorld
> About the MapWorld.

MapWorld is an area where you can build custom maps to place in item frames. 
This means you can create pretty pictures or signs! There is a warp sign at 
spawn that will take you there.

Materials are provided, but ++your inventory is cleared on entry and exit++. 
ModReq for a plot you would like. Read this post in order to retrieve your map: 
https://redd.it/4bp8ti. To return to the center of the MapWorld, type `/spawn`.
There is a warp sign there that will return you to the overworld.

All normal server rules apply in MapWorld, including no NSFW builds.


### Minecarts
> Fast minecarts on PvE

Minecarts on PvE run at up to double vanilla Minecraft minecart speed, thanks
to the HyperCarts plugin (https://github.com/NerdNu/HyperCarts). In order to
boost a minecart to its theoretical maximum speed, you may need to lay powered
rails considerably closer together than you would in vanilla Minecraft. If you
don't care about speed, the standard rail designs you used in vanilla will work
just fine.

If you have problems (with lag or minecart physics acting up) you can set a
personal speed limit for minecarts that you ride in. Use `/cart-speed 0.4` to
set your personal speed limit to normal, vanilla speed. Use `/cart-speed 0.8`
to set the speed limit to the server-wide maximum. Or specify some other number
for an in-between speed. Your personal speed limit is saved forever. You can
check your current speed limit with `/cart-speed`.

Chest and hopper carts always run at the maximum speed configured server-wide.


### ModReqs
> Moderator Requests for assistance.

If you need assistance from a moderator, type `/modreq your message here`.
Your request will be added to a queue and a staff member will help you as soon
as possible. If you are stuck in a protected region, message a moderator 
directly, rather than waiting for a ModReq. Do not use ModReqs to ask for help
with building or for simple questions about the game. Ask other players or
check the Minecraft wiki at http://minecraft.gamepedia.com.

You do not need to be online for your request to be fulfilled. The coordinates
where you ran `/modreq` are saved with your request. You typically use ModReqs
to make water/lava flow, report grief or other rule-breaking, or to get your
build protected.

You can see your open requests with `/check` or by visiting http://nerd.nu/modreq/pve.pl.
You can cancel a request with `/done <number>`.


### Mumble
> About our Mumble voice-chat system.

You can talk to other players and staff on our Mumble voice-chat server at 
**mumble.nerd.nu**, port **6162**. Download a Mumble client for your system from 
http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page. Please configure a push-to-talk key 
rather than using voice activation.

We also support Discord for text and voice chat. See `/help Discord`.


### Nerd
> About the nerd.nu organisation.

The nerd.nu organisation is run entirely by volunteers and completely funded by 
donations from players. You can find out more on the web. See `/help Web`.


### Pets
> About pets.

Pets are tamed animals such as cats and dogs, farm animals (e.g sheep) that 
have been named with a nametag, or trapped hostile mobs. It is against the 
rules to kill another player's pets. Note that hostile mobs will eventually 
despawn unless named with a nametag.


### Places
> Finding places using `/place`.

Places are points of interest on the server. They are typically towns, grinders
and other often-travelled areas. You can see a list of places by typing
`/place`. Type `/place <location>` to see its coordinates and to be pointed
in the right direction. 

Type `/place endportal` or `/place netherportal` to see the _nearest_ end 
or nether portal, respectively. You can find the place nearest to your current 
location using `/nearest-place`.

Places are created when requested by ModReq, subject to admin approval.


### Plugins
> Descriptions of all server plugins.

Plugins can be listed with `/pl`. You can get help on a specific plugin with 
`/help <plugin>`.

You can also find a complete list of plugin documentation on our wiki at
http://wiki.nerd.nu/wiki/Plugins.


### Portals
> About portals.

Nether portal creation by players has been disabled on this server. Instead,
all nether portals are created by the P admins, and only a limited number of 
these are allowed. The admins place bedrock portal markers in the world before 
the start of the rev. Whoever finds one of these is entitled to specify the size
and shape of the portal that the admins place. There are some limitations:
the portal must be at ground level, it must be within 100 blocks of the marker,
and the internal area of the portal can be no more than 25 blocks.


### Protection
> Protecting your builds.

Protections allow only you and those you add to permissions to build within an 
area. Undeveloped land will not be protected. Only completed or mostly-completed
structures will be protected by moderators. Protections usually extend from 
about 10 blocks below the lowest level of your build all the way to Y 255. 

Protections can not be used to claim resources or land; they are only to 
prevent griefing of your build. Large claims may not be granted protection in
their entirety, initially. Instead, staff will protect those parts of the 
claim that have been built on.

You may request your build be protected using `/modreq`. In order to do this 
place two blocks that are easily identifiable (colored wool works well) at the
two opposite corners of your build. Try to make it so that someone who does 
not know what you are building will be able to identify the boundaries. Then 
type `/modreq please protect my build marked with <block>` at one of the 
corners and a moderator will create a protection for you.

Protections are implemented as WorldGuard regions, which have owners and 
members. Members can build in the region, and owners can do everything 
members can do as well as add other owners and members. You can find out
what region you are standing in with `/region info` (`/rg i` for short) or 
you can right click on blocks with a wooden sword. You can add additional 
members or owners to a protection region with `/rg addmember <region> <player>`
and `/rg addowner <region> <player>`, respectively.


### PvE
> About PvE, the game.

PvE stands for ‘Player vs. Environment’. This means Survival mode, with the 
hardest difficulty, and no PvP (Player vs. Player combat).


### Redstone
> About redstone devices.

Fast-running clocks or redstone devices with many hoppers, pistons or lamps can 
have a disproportionately detrimental effect on server performance for their 
size and may be disabled by staff at their discretion. Please endeavour to 
design redstone devices with minimal numbers of hoppers and avoid fast clocks. 
Consider replacing hopper chains with water flows over ice and replacing clocks 
with daylight sensors or BUDs. See also `/help Lag`.


### Region Locks
> Shared locks for region members.

Containers (chests, furnaces, etc) can be privately locked, yet accessible to 
all members of a WorldGuard region, using `/cmodify r:<region>`. You can 
ModReq to create a 1x1x1 block region for the purpose of managing access to 
shared containers, even if you have no substantial build for the region to 
protect. See also `/help Locks`.


### Restarts
> About server restarts.

Every two hours our server restarts to help it run more smoothly. Players are 
sent to the lobby. A warning will appear on your screen 1 minute before, as 
well as a 10 second countdown. If you have your inventory open just before the 
restart, you could lose items, so be careful! When the restart has completed 
you can either fly through the “P” portal or type `/pve` to return to the 
server. You can see when the next server restart will happen with `/nextrestart`.


### Revisions
> About map revisions.

We start a new world, from scratch, typically every 3-6 months, at the 
discretion of the P admins. This is called a “revision” or “rev”. No items are 
carried over into the new map. You start over with nothing. This is PvE 
Revision ${rev-number}, which began on ${rev-date}. See ${rev-post} for 
details. All previous map revisions are available for download. See `/help Web`.


### Rules
> The rules of PvE in brief.

* Be respectful to other players.
* No sexism, racism, homophobia, or other hate speech is allowed.
* No chat spam, advertising, or excessive trolling. 
* Do not reveal personal information about other players.
* Absolutely no impersonation of staff is allowed.
* Do not grief, spam blocks, or harvest crops without replanting. See also 
  `/help Farms`, `/help Grief`.
* Do not kill a player’s trapped mobs or animals. See also `/help Pets`.
* If using another player’s farm remember to leave their breeding pair.
* Do not x-ray - you will lose all of your items and edits. See also 
  `/help X-Ray`.
* Do not exploit bugs or glitches or attempt to circumvent our protection 
  plugins including, but not limited to, LWC, WorldGuard, and NoCheatPlus.
* Do not use hacks or hacked clients; that will get you banned.
* No killing or trapping players except in clearly marked arenas.
* No “Not Safe For Work” (NSFW) builds or skins.
* Do not restrict access to builds, the map is considered open for exploration.
* Exceptions and additional rules can be found at http://nerd.nu/rules. 

See also `/help Bans`.


### Servers
> About other nerd.nu servers.

There are three Minecraft servers currently active on the Nerd.Nu network: PvE,
Creative and Minigames. You can access them with `/pve`, `/creative` or 
`/minigames`.

  
### Spawn
> About spawn.

Spawn is located at (0, 0). It has a Nether portal and a large number of 
melon farms, as well as information about the server and server rules. 
Type `/place spawn` to be pointed in the right direction!


### Staff
> About the staff of nerd.nu.

At nerd.nu, as much as possible, all players are treated equally, so you won't
see special titles for staff names in chat. To see which staff are currently 
in-game, use `/list` or `/modlist`. You can see the full list of all current 
and past staff at http://nerd.nu/staff.


### Steam
> Find us on Steam.

Our steam group is http://steamcommunity.com/groups/nerdnu.


### Stuck
> Stuck in a protection?

Occasionally players find themselves stuck in a place where they can't dig or 
place blocks to escape. In such circumstances, it is better to directly message
a moderator and ask for help, rather than waiting for a ModReq to be handled.


### Teleports
> Teleports, homes and warps.

Currently, teleporting is disabled on PvE. Use portals for fast travel.


### Towns
> Building with others in a town.

Towns are large builds shared by a group of players. By convention, towns share 
a protection region, and the region owners are referred to as “mayors”, since 
only they can add new region members. Typically, towns will not be granted 
protection over their whole claim area until substantial builds are present. 
However, you can `/modreq` to ask for a small region to be made to lock 
shared chests to all region members (see `/help Region Locks`).

Although mayors can set standards for builds within their town and even evict 
members, it is against the rules to remove non-compliant builds against the 
builder’s wishes. Instead, do a ModReq asking an admin to move the build for you.


### Volunteer
> How to help the servers.

You can apply to be a moderator at http://nerd.nu/applyformod.
If you are a Java programmer, you can submit pull requests for our plugins. 
Look for us on GitHub: https://github.com/NerdNu.


### Warps
> About the `/warp` command.

Warping is occasionally enabled on PvE to go to special events. But for the most
part, you must walk, use a vehicle, or use regular in-game nether portals and 
end portals.


### Water
> About water.

See `/help Liquids`.

### X-Ray
> Rules about seeing through opaque blocks.

Any mechanism that allows you to see through normally opaque blocks in order to
obtain an in-game advantage is against the rules. This includes x-ray client 
mods, some vanilla contraptions (typically made using transparent blocks) and 
some texture packs. Ore-radar mods that give you an awareness of ores nearby
are also against the rules.
 
X-raying is regarded as a serious offence. It deprives other players of the 
opportunity to find resources through legitimate means. Any resources that 
x-rayers find can be used to progress in the game faster than legitimate 
players.

Accordingly, if you are caught x-raying, you will be banned for one month, all 
of your edits will be un-done and all of your items taken away.

Because all edits are logged, it is not necessary for staff to be on-line 
during the act to catch an x-rayer. The majority of x-ray bans result from 
investigations that happen several hours _after_ a player has x-rayed.


### XRay
> See `/help x-ray`.
